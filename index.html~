      <p class="closer">This game has been developed as a mini project. This means that it is probably full of bugs, but you're just gonna have to live with that. How it works: Enter a number (as a starting point I recommend 12) into the top box and press 'Go!'. Then answer the question in the bottom box and press ENTER or 'Submit'. If you got it right, another question will appear. You cannot change the value in the top box without restarting the game.</p>
      <p class="base">This project was originally in python3! It has more functionality and you can get it off my <a href="https://github.com/PythonJellyfish">Github</a>!
